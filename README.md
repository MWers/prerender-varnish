# prerender-varnish

prerender-varnish is a Varnish 3 configuration for serving pre-rendered HTML from Javascript pages/apps using [prerender.io](http://prerender.io/).

prerender-varnish is currently in a pre-alpha state. Anything can *and likely will* change.

## Using prerender-varnish

To use prerender-varnish, symlink `prerender.vcl` and `prerender_backend.vcl` in your Varnish configuration directory (usually `/etc/varnish`) and add them to your primary Varnish configuration file:

```c
include "prerender.vcl";
```

## Updating prerender.io backend

The prerender.io rendering service is hosted on Heroku and Heroku (and AWS ELB) domains resolve to multiple IP addresses. Varnish requires backend hosts to resolve to a single unchanging IP address. As a workaround, `backend_generator.py` will query DNS for the prerender.io rendering service, generate a Varnish director containing all rendering service IP addresses, write it to `prerender_backend.vcl`, and reload Varnish when the configuration changes.

Run `backend_generator.py` as follows:

```bash
VARNISH_SECRET=xxxxxxx python backend_generator.py

Usage: backend_generator.py [options]

Generate a Varnish backend configuration given a hostname.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                        prerender.io rendering backend hostname [default:
                        service.prerender.io]
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  prerender.io rendering backend port [default: 80]
  -d BACKEND_CONF, --dest=BACKEND_CONF
                        varnish backend conf file to overwrite [default:
                        /etc/varnish/prerender_backend.vcl]
  -r, --reload-varnish  reload varnish on completion [default: False]
  -v, --verbose         show verbose output [default: False]
  --dry-run             don't write to conf file or reload Varnish [default:
                        False]
```

With TTLs for these DNS records set quite low, it is advised to run this very frequently. Once per minute should be sufficient.
